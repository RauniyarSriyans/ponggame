# ponggame

Hi therre, 
This is a classic pong game created using Python. The game has the following basic rules:

1. This is a two player game. One player can use the arrow keys to move the paddle up and down while the other can use the "s" and "w" key to move the paddles. 
2. Everytime you miss the ball, the other player gets a score. 

Enjoy!
